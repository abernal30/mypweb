# Preface {-}

We started writing this book as guidance for some undergraduate courses related to algorithms and financial programming. We extend the content to become a book for those who wish to start learning to program in R or want to expand their knowledge in programming with applications in finance. The codes of this book are in R and were written in RStudio Markdowns because it is a worldwide known programming language.   
This book aims to get some introductory programming competencies, as well as in the topics of data cleaning, data analysis, and machine learning, and to employ those concepts in finance.

The R and other files are stored in the [GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/abernal30/BookAFP).
